            <h3><em>Non-releasable Wild-born Red Fox</em></h3>
            <p>Porsha is a pet surrender that came from out of state. Although Porsha had an extremely loving owner for two years, owning a fox is illegal in most states without proper licensing. Porsha’s owner realized that their current situation could end badly - oftentimes situations like this end in euthanasia of the animal, because there aren’t many rescues who take in foxes - and she did the right thing and reached out for help with placement.<br><br>Porsha has a fun, youthful personality, and she goes between super sassy to super loving in seconds. She's a great example of why it's so important to be able to recognize and be familiar with body language when working with foxes. She's a very comical fox!</p>

            <h3>Tundra - <em>Captive-born Red Fox</em><br>Cleo - <em>Captive-born Arctic Fox</em></h3>
            <p>Tundra is a male Red Fox (marble color morph) and Cleo is a female Arctic Fox.<br><br>This pair came from a wildlife education organization who operated as a traveling zoo. Unfortunately, like many businesses, the pandemic caused them to have to close their doors, and their animals had to be placed elsewhere. Thankfully, they found their way to us for placement for Tundra and Cleo.<br><br>I don’t know the full, original backstory about these guys, but it sounds like both came to this organization as rescue cases to start out - possibly a pet surrender and a fur farm rescue.<br><br>Is anyone thinking “Wait, an Arctic and a Red species cohabitating together?!”<br><br>That’s right - these two have been housed together for several years! I have no intentions of separating the pair. Although not unheard of, it is not as common for the two species to get along in captivity. In the wild, Arctic Foxes and Red Foxes are enemies, as the larger, more powerful, Red species is quickly overlapping the territory of Arctic Foxes. Cleo and Tundra are absolutely considered a bonded pair; during the spring, when wild foxes would be raising young, Tundra caters to Cleo as if she was a Mama fox. He will save his treats and bring them to her, he'll carry toys around in his mouth - whilst making soft, loving whines - treating them like his "babies". Trust me, if you saw the way he treats his lady during that season, you'd wish you had a partner like that, too!<br><br>These two have bonded strongly to me, and I have a wonderful relationship with them (although it was rocky in the beginning with Tundra - he gave me the worst bite wound I've ever received from a fox!). These lovebirds have quickly become superstars of Arctic Fox Daily.</p>
            
            <h2 class="title">Micah &amp; Pearl's Story</h2>

            <img src="images/Pearl.avif" alt="A Red Fox wearing a muzzle being held by a vet." width="260" height="259" class="foxpics">
            <h3>Micah - <em>Captive-born Red Fox</em><br>Pearl - <em>Captive-born Red Fox</em></h3>
            <p>These two were placed with us after being confiscated by law enforcement from a fellow New York State facility. In most areas, special licenses are required to own exotic/wild animals. In New York State, for example, I hold multiple state and federal licenses in order to legally care for, raise, and provide sanctuary to both the wild and captive-bred foxes. I feel blessed to be able to provide a home to displaced animals like this, as there aren’t many of us fox rescues around the United States, and many confiscated or re-homed foxes don’t have a happy fate.<br><br>Pearl and Micah came in with both internal and external parasites, and Micah was matted very badly on his back end (you can see where he’s plucked most of the mats away and his skin is bare), but aside from that, they were in good spirits upon arrival to our facility&#33;</p>
